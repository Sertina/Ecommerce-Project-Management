E-commerce Project Management using SimulTrain

The goal was to successfully manage an e-commerce project using Simultrain software with 16 resources, 17 activities and a fixed budget scheduled to complete over 55 days.
The project was divided into three execution phases of 4 weeks each. After every phase, the project progress was evaluated to document the current status, learnings and future decisions.
SimulTrain provided a real-life experience of managing the project deliverables and the resource optimization.
